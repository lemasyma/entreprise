# Specifications
* Big Word document listing everything
* 60 pages to summarize the existing project

## Issue #1 - No deep specifications
* Features were not really designed, or only briefly
* You cannot resume a project of 5 years in some pages

## Good #1 - No full rework
* Some features were too big to redo in 4 months
* We choose not to go totally crazy and kept some technologies

# How we did
## Team split

## Issue #3 - Technical context switch
* OVH servers: 256 Gb RAM, 40 CPU
* AWS EC2: 8 Gb RAM, 2 CPU

## Issue #4 - Late warning
* En retard sur l'emploi du temps

# Result
> It's all good

## Good #2 - Refocus
* When we say the poor traction from smaller clients, we moved our focys to migrating the existing ones
* This meant rethinking the prioritization of features
* We checked with each clients what they were actually using and focused on that

## Client migration
* Old platform dying
* Had to move all clients to the new platform
* 2 years migration

## Team growth
* Started with 6 personnes
